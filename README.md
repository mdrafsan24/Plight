# Plight
Plight is built with the real world in mind, adding a social aspect as well as more features, including the ability to create healing zones to earn more points. Once the user signs up, he/she is automatically assigned a certain disease as well as an immunity to one. Throughout the game, the user spreads the disease by locating other players who don't have immunity to that disease and passing it on by getting close to them (in terms of location). Once the user is close enough, the target has exactly 15 seconds to use the shield appropriate number of times (depending on the disease). Once the user earns 50 points or more, he/she can go into building a healing zone where other infected people can get healed for the diseases they have. In the process, the one who gets healed loses 5 points which the user picks up.
